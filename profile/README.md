# Welcome to *Doctelligence* üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of the **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, a pioneering initiative in the development of decentralized AI and data systems.

At the core of *Doctelligence* is **DIN**, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network that enables secure and scalable AI training using decentralized data.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*

At Doctelligence, we combine cutting-edge technologies to drive the future of **artificial intelligence (AI)**. By integrating **blockchain**, federated learning, privacy-preserving technologies, and solutions like IPFS into a cohesive ecosystem, we prioritize data ownership, privacy, and accessibility. This innovative ecosystem enables the secure, decentralized training of AI models at scale, fostering breakthroughs while ensuring data sovereignty.

**DIN** (Decentralized Intelligence Network) empowers both AI developers and data owners:

- **For AI Developers**: DIN provides secure, decentralized access to diverse datasets, enabling scalable model training and fostering innovation without the constraints of centralized data silos.
  
- **For Data Owners**: DIN enables individuals, SMEs, enterprises, and users of decentralized storage solutions to retain full ownership of their data, monetize it, and unlock its economic potential. By improving data availability and access, DIN overcomes traditional data silos and drives AI innovation, all while ensuring compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Empower AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores, ensuring full control and ownership over personal and organizational data.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Securely train AI models on a decentralized network, utilizing blockchain to facilitate model updates while maintaining data privacy and encouraging open collaboration.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for participating in AI training processes, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributors.

## The Entities Behind *Doctelligence*

*Doctelligence* consists of two key entities that support and advance the **DIN** network:

- **Doctelligence Ltd. üî¨**  
  This entity focuses on developing decentralized AI (DecAI) technologies, advancing innovative, open, and transparent solutions that push the boundaries of decentralized AI.

- **Doctelligence Foundation üåê**  
  The Foundation fosters a community-driven ecosystem where decentralized AI technologies are accessible to all. It supports innovation, governance, and growth within the network, ensuring that development is decentralized and no single entity has control.

**DIN**, the network itself, operates independently and is secured by a decentralized network of participants. It is not owned or controlled by any single party, and all interactions within the network are transparently recorded on an immutable public blockchain. This decentralized architecture promotes openness, transparency, and collective participation, ensuring that **DIN** remains a truly community-driven network.

## Explore Our White Paper

The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** has been selected from over **100+ speaker applications** to be showcased at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This prestigious event showcased **DIN** as the only integrated network for **Decentralized AI (DeAI)**, highlighting its unique potential in advancing decentralized AI and data sovereignty. The summit featured contributions from some of the most influential organizations and leaders in the fields of AI and decentralization, including **NVIDIA**, **Google**, **Oasis Labs (Founder)**, and **Worldcoin Foundation** to name a few.
