# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundations of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**. **DIN** presents a novel framework addressing critical challenges in AI development while preserving data sovereignty. As AI advances rapidly, the paradox of abundant yet inaccessible data due to fragmentation and siloing limits both individual data sovereignty and AI development potential. DIN offers a solution through a decentralized architecture that enables scalable AI development while maintaining individual control over data.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

We believe the future lies in collaborative ecosystems where data can be decentralized, and every participant retains ownership while contributing to a collective intelligence. By integrating blockchain, federated learning, and decentralized incentives, we align individual empowerment with societal progress:

-ðŸ’»**Data Control**
Utilize decentralized data to unlock new opportunities for AI development.
-ðŸ¤–**Blockchain & AI**
Leverage blockchain technology to securely train AI by sharing model updates while protecting data and fostering innovation.
-ðŸ’°**Direct Rewards**
Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, without intermediaries.

*Doctelligence* is committed to decentralizing intelligence and enhancing outcomes across industries by aligning with global standards and frameworks. By ensuring that data never leaves its original store, *DIN*'s approach naturally complies with regulations, preserving data sovereignty while facilitating scalable and innovative AI solutions. Our model aligns with key regulatory bodies, including:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Ensuring data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Safeguarding sensitive patient information in the United States.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Providing data privacy rights to residents of California, USA.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data in Canada.
  
***Doctelligence* operates as a decentralized and open-source framework; no single entity owns or controls it.** This collaborative model ensures that it remains a truly community-driven initiative.

## Vision
*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)*, on which *Doctelligence* is founded, is designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. *DIN* facilitates effective AI training within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources. It leverages decentralized technologies to address key challenges in data fragmentation and siloing, enabling a more integrated and accessible AI ecosystem.

***DIN* was showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.** Explore our white paper here:

- **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)** â€“ This paper introduces the core *DIN* framework, laying the groundwork for decentralized intelligence across various sectors.

Other future modular extensions may include, for example:

- **[DHIN (Decentralized Health Intelligence Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240)** â€“ A modular extension of *DIN*, *DHIN* specifically focuses on decentralized health applications, providing a tailored approach to health data management and intelligence.
- **DPIN (Decentralized Physical Intelligence Network):** Tailored for decentralized physical and IoT applications.
- **DEIN (Decentralized EdTech Intelligence Network):** Focused on transforming education through decentralized technologies.
- **DAIN (Decentralized Agritech Intelligence Network):** Aimed at advancing agricultural practices through decentralized innovations.

As we expand the DIN network's capabilities, we explore various theoretical modular extensions where the **DIN toolkit can be deployed, including non-speculative, stablecoin-based, circular token economies.** For the Doctelligence community, ensuring fair rewards and stable data valuation is crucial. Guidance includes exploring stablecoins for reliable compensation and to mitigate volatility, while also considering other mechanisms to maintain data value across network extensions.
