# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN), at the core of Doctelligence, is a fully peer-to-peer blockchain network protocol that enables decentralized AI training on distributed, underutilized data sources at scale.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At Doctelligence, we integrate blockchain, IPFS, federated learning, privacy-preserving technologies, and decentralized computation to advance AI development on distributed data stores‚Äîall within a truly peer-to-peer blockchain protocol network.

DIN empowers data owners‚Äîincluding individuals, SMEs, enterprises, and users of decentralized data storage solutions‚Äîto retain ownership of their data, monetize it, and unlock its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, DIN overcomes siloed systems, drives AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Features:

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Our Vision

Doctelligence is an open-source, peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that decentralizes AI training and transforms the web of data architecture. It enables users to retain control over their data and identity, rewards them financially, and fosters new economies, all while operating independently of central authorities within a secure and transparent network.

At the heart of **Doctelligence** are two entities created to derive value and support the network:

- **Doctelligence Ltd. üî¨:** This entity is financed to develop decentralized AI (DecAI) technologies. Its focus is on creating innovative solutions that advance the field of AI in a decentralized, transparent, and open manner, driving technological progress within the network.

- **Doctelligence Foundation üåç:** Supporting the broader mission, the Foundation empowers individuals, organizations, and sectors with decentralized AI technologies. It helps nurture a community-driven ecosystem where innovation, governance, and growth are decentralized, without a single point of control.

While these entities play critical roles in advancing and supporting the network, the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) itself remains independent. It is operated and secured entirely by decentralized entities, with participation driven by peer-to-peer interactions on a public, immutable blockchain ledger. This ensures the network remains open, transparent, and peer-driven at all levels.

## Explore Our White Paper

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** was selected from over **100+ speaker applications** to be showcased at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC. This prestigious event featured contributions from some of the most influential organizations and leaders in the fields of AI and decentralization.
