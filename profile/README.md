# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** empowers individuals with control over an **open-source personal health record**, securely storing their data for life. It facilitates **AI model training** on this data while keeping it **local**, ensuring it remains secure and never exposed or transferred. Users are rewarded with **stablecoins** (e.g., **RAI**, **USDT**) for their participation. With just an internet connection, anyone can access the network and set up infrastructure to create **local healthcare solutions**, while contributing to a **self-funded health system**.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*  

- üíª **True Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full control** of your health records while benefiting from AI model training. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring both **privacy** and **security**.  

- ü§ñ **Scalable Federated Learning (FL)**  
  A decentralized AI infrastructure where models are trained across an expanding network of personal data stores‚Äîwithout centralizing or exposing raw data.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Stablecoin Rewards**  
  Earn **direct stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDT)** for securely contributing to AI models. No intermediaries‚Äîjust transparent, trustless compensation.  

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê  

**No single entity owns or controls the Doctelligence network**‚Äîit operates as an **open, permissionless infrastructure**, governed by the community. With an emphasis on **decentralization**, the Foundation supports **community-driven governance**, keeping the protocol **open**, **transparent**, and **adaptable**.
