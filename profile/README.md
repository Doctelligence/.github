# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a **decentralized, open-source network** for **personal health records (PHRs)** that lets individuals **own, monetize, and protect** their health data. It creates a **peer-to-peer health AI network**, enabling **secure, privacy-preserving AI development** through **federated learning (FL)**. AI models are trained on **encrypted data** without exposing personal records, ensuring confidentiality.

For clinicians, it simplifies access to health data in one unified location, overcoming the limitations of siloed systems. This model scales beyond traditional infrastructures, unlocking **greater potential for data scalability** in **AI** and **analytics**.

The network also enables **private data monetization**, **stablecoin rewards**, and contributions to **decentralized health insurance**, where individuals help fund **health coverage**. Operating within a **scalable, permissionless ecosystem**, it ensures **fair compensation** and **access** to decentralized healthcare.

As an **open-source protocol**, *Doctelligence* fosters **transparency**, **innovation**, and **global accessibility**.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*  

- üíª **True Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full control** of your health records while benefiting from AI model training. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring both **privacy** and **security**.  

- ü§ñ **Scalable Federated Learning (FL)**  
  A decentralized AI infrastructure where models are trained across an expanding network of personal data stores‚Äîwithout centralizing or exposing raw data.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Stablecoin Rewards**  
  Earn **direct stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDT)** for securely contributing to AI models. No intermediaries‚Äîjust transparent, trustless compensation.  

## Foundation üåê  

*Doctelligence Foundation* ensures the **long-term sustainability and evolution** of the ecosystem. **No single entity owns or controls the Doctelligence network**‚Äîit is an **open and permissionless infrastructure**, governed by the community. With a focus on **decentralization**, the Foundation supports **community-driven governance**, keeping the protocol **open, transparent, and adaptable**.  

## Explore the White Paper  

Doctelligence's AI solution was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of **scaling decentralized AI** through **data ownership and privacy-preserving methods**.  

To dive into the technical and philosophical foundations, explore our **[White Paper](https://github.com/Doctelligence/White-Paper/blob/main/Decentralized%20Intelligence%20Network%20(DIN).pdf)**.
