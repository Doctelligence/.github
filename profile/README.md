# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** enables a decentralized AI ecosystem where data stores can monetize their information directly, keeping it secure and localized. By participating in this ecosystem, users earn cryptographic rewards for contributing to on-device AI training, maintaining control over their data, and eliminating intermediaries. This approach fosters a more efficient, inclusive, and scalable data-driven environment.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we integrate decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and incentive mechanisms to empower individuals while enhancing the efficiency and scalability of AI development. We aim to align data control with better outcomes across industries, ensuring compliance with global data sovereignty regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- ðŸ’» **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ðŸ¤– **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- ðŸ’° **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Vision

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized, open-source framework with no single controlling entity, supported by the **Doctelligence Foundation**. Our commercial arm facilitates traditional funding for dedicated research into advanced technologies, benefiting the community and delivering industry-specific solutions.

### Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the foundation of *Doctelligence*, is designed to facilitate decentralized AI training across decentralized data sources. By utilizing decentralized technologies, DIN creates an integrated, accessible AI ecosystem that enhances collaboration and data privacy.

*DIN* was showcased at the **Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.
