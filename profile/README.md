#  Doctelligence 🚀

**Doctelligence** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning (FL) protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure AI collaboration and data monetization. It powers **open AI and data marketplaces**, where models can be trained **without reliance on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers**, supporting individually owned, data-driven economies.

## 🔄 Circular Data Economies  

Data economies have historically concentrated wealth at the top, often leaving contributors uncompensated. **Doctelligence** enables a **circular economy**, where **data owners receive continuous rewards**, and AI-driven insights **feed back into goods and services** that return value across industries—driving **cross-sector, self-sustaining innovation**.

Blockchain technology opened the door to reconstructing our social and economic configurations—bypassing middle-persons to enable more inclusive, cooperative systems. It was as much a **social technology** as a technical one: Bitcoin didn’t seek approval from banks, and Ethereum didn’t try to list applications in the app store. These networks reshaped the rules of participation, laying the groundwork for systems like **Doctelligence** to empower individuals within data ecosystems, rather than extract from them.

## 🌍 Empowering Sovereign Data & AI Development  

Our infrastructure is ideal for **self-sovereign identity networks** and **decentralized data ecosystems**, and supports FL training for **decentralized data marketplaces**, enabling trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring sovereignty and compliance.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries.

## 🔐 Key Features of Doctelligence  

- 💻 **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Retain **full control** over your data while enabling AI training in a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**—no centralized oversight or data movement.  

- 🤖 **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Utilize **Federated Learning (FL)** and a **peer-to-peer network** to enable **privacy-preserving AI model updates**. Data never leaves local storage—only encrypted model improvements are shared, ensuring **secure collaboration** between data providers and AI developers.  

- 💰 **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn high-frequency **stablecoin (e.g., RAI) rewards** transparently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring **fair, direct compensation** for all network participants.

## 🌐 Foundation & Governance  

*Doctelligence Foundation* is a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting the evolution of the protocol through **open governance** and the advancement of **self-sovereign AI ecosystems**. Much like Ethereum, **no single entity owns the network**—it is sustained by a global community and secured through **decentralized validators** rather than centralized gatekeepers. This decentralized foundation ensures the **long-term sustainability** and resilience of the ecosystem.  

We are recipients of a **Cosmos Institute** Grant: [cosmos-institute.org](https://cosmos-institute.org/), based in Austin, Texas and the University of Oxford.
