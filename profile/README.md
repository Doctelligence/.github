# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** enables a decentralized AI ecosystem where data stores can monetize their information directly, keeping it secure and localized. By participating in this ecosystem, users earn cryptographic rewards for contributing to on-device AI training, maintaining control over their data, and eliminating intermediaries. This approach fosters a more efficient, inclusive, and scalable data-driven environment.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we integrate decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and incentive mechanisms to empower individuals while enhancing the efficiency and scalability of AI development. We aim to align data control with better outcomes across industries, ensuring compliance with global data sovereignty regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- ðŸ’» **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ðŸ¤– **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- ðŸ’° **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

### Data Sovereignty & Compliance

**Doctelligence** is dedicated to maintaining data sovereignty while meeting key regulatory requirements:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Protecting individual privacy within the European Union.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Safeguarding sensitive patient data in the U.S.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Upholding data privacy rights for California residents.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Regulating the use of personal data in Canada.

## Vision

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized, open-source framework with no single controlling entity, supported by the **Doctelligence Foundation**. Our commercial arm facilitates traditional funding for dedicated research into advanced technologies, benefiting the community and delivering industry-specific solutions.

### Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the foundation of *Doctelligence*, is designed to facilitate decentralized AI training across distributed data sources. By utilizing decentralized technologies, DIN creates an integrated, accessible AI ecosystem that enhances collaboration and data privacy.

*DIN* was showcased at the **Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.

### Explore Our White Paper

- **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)** â€“ This foundational paper outlines the *DIN* framework, which sets the stage for the decentralized intelligence revolution across industries.

### Future Modular Extensions

As *Doctelligence* expands, additional modular extensions are planned, including:

- **[DHIN (Decentralized Health Intelligence Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240)** â€“ A modular extension of *DIN*, *DHIN* focuses specifically on decentralized health applications, providing a tailored approach to health data management and intelligence.
- **DPIN (Decentralized Physical Intelligence Network)** â€“ Tailored for decentralized physical and IoT applications.
- **DEIN (Decentralized EdTech Intelligence Network)** â€“ Focused on transforming education through decentralized technologies.
- **DAIN (Decentralized Agritech Intelligence Network)** â€“ Aimed at advancing agricultural practices through decentralized innovations.

Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of **in-the-loop economies**, where decentralized systems, coupled with intelligent economic models, create self-sustaining ecosystems. These economies integrate tokenized incentives directly into AI development, fostering growth and sustainability within the loop. This could extend to circular token economies, where contributions to data and AI training directly influence economic outcomes, creating an ecosystem that continually adapts and evolves.

As we expand the **DIN** network's capabilities, we explore various theoretical modular extensions, including the integration of non-speculative circular token economies that could redefine value and participation in decentralized ecosystems.
