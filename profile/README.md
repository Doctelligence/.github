# Doctelligence Network üöÄ  

**Doctelligence** is a **decentralized, scalable, and open-source network of Personal Health Records (PHRs)**, where individuals **own and monetize their health data while maintaining full privacy**. Using **scalable federated learning (FL)**, AI models are trained on **encrypted data** **without moving or exposing personal records**, enabling secure and **privacy-preserving AI development** across a growing network.  

This empowers **private data monetization**, **high-frequency stablecoin rewards**, and contributions to **decentralized health insurance**‚Äîa system where individuals can **monetize their health data while contributing to collective risk pools** for community-driven health coverage. All of this operates within a **scalable, permissionless ecosystem**, ensuring fair compensation and access to decentralized healthcare solutions.  

As an **open-source protocol**, *Doctelligence* fosters **transparency, community-driven innovation, and global accessibility**.  

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*  

- üíª **True Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full control** of your health records while benefiting from AI model training. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring both **privacy** and **security**.  

- ü§ñ **Scalable Federated Learning (FL)**  
  A decentralized AI infrastructure where models are trained across an expanding network of personal data stores‚Äîwithout centralizing or exposing raw data.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Stablecoin Rewards**  
  Earn **direct stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDT)** for securely contributing to AI models. No intermediaries‚Äîjust transparent, trustless compensation.  

## Foundation üåê  

*Doctelligence Foundation* ensures the **long-term sustainability and evolution** of the ecosystem. **No single entity owns or controls the Doctelligence network**‚Äîit is an **open and permissionless infrastructure**, governed by the community. With a focus on **decentralization**, the Foundation supports **community-driven governance**, keeping the protocol **open, transparent, and adaptable**.  

## Explore the White Paper  

Doctelligence's AI solution was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of **scaling decentralized AI** through **data ownership and privacy-preserving methods**.  

To dive into the technical and philosophical foundations, explore our **[White Paper](https://github.com/Doctelligence/White-Paper/blob/main/Decentralized%20Intelligence%20Network%20(DIN).pdf)**.
