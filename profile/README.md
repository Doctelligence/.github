# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**. 

At the core of Doctelligence is the **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, a fully peer-to-peer blockchain network protocol that enables AI training on decentralized data at scale. DIN integrates blockchain, federated learning, privacy-preserving technologies, decentralized identities, and solutions like IPFS into a secure ecosystem that ensures data ownership and drives the future of AI.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At Doctelligence, we combine blockchain, federated learning, privacy-preserving, and decentralized technologies to advance AI development on decentralized data stores. We empower AI developers by providing them with secure, decentralized access to diverse datasets, enabling innovation and model training at scale. Simultaneously, we empower data owners‚Äîincluding individuals, SMEs, enterprises, and users of decentralized data storage solutions‚Äîby allowing them to retain ownership of their data, monetize it, and unlock its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, DIN overcomes siloed systems, drives AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Features:

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Our Vision

Doctelligence is an open-source, peer-to-peer blockchain protocol designed to restructure and decentralize the current internet, specifically for AI training on a decentralized web of data architecture. It enables the creation, transfer, and distribution of economic value on a peer-to-peer basis, allowing users to maintain control over their data, identity, and future. Operating independently of central authorities, Doctelligence fosters a secure and transparent network where individuals can own and profit from their data. Our investment strategy is focused on fundamental technologies that form the backbone of Web 3.0, alongside infrastructure projects that leverage this decentralized framework for AI development and beyond.

## The Entities Behind Doctelligence

At the heart of **Doctelligence** are two key entities designed to derive value and support the network:

- **Doctelligence Ltd. üî¨:** Focused on developing decentralized AI (DecAI) technologies, this entity drives innovative solutions in AI that are decentralized, transparent, and open, pushing the technological progress of the network.

- **Doctelligence Foundation üåê:** Empowering individuals, organizations, and sectors with decentralized AI technologies, the Foundation nurtures a community-driven ecosystem where innovation, governance, and growth are decentralized, with no single point of control.

The Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) remains independent and is operated and secured by decentralized entities. Participation is driven by peer-to-peer interactions on a public, immutable blockchain ledger, ensuring the network is open, transparent, and peer-driven at all levels.

## Explore Our White Paper

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** was selected from over **100+ speaker applications** to be showcased at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC. This prestigious event featured contributions from some of the most influential organizations and leaders in the fields of AI and decentralization. **We were the only network to be showcased**, highlighting the uniqueness and significance of our work in advancing decentralized AI and data sovereignty.
