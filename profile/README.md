# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a **decentralized health AI network** that gives individuals full control over their **personal health records (PHRs)**, securely stored for their lifetime in one place. It uses a **peer-to-peer protocol** to enable secure **data monetization** through **federated learning (FL)**. AI models are trained on **encrypted data** without exposing personal health information.

All that's needed is an internet connection to **use Doctelligence**. This allows individuals to access the network, set up healthcare solutions in their local communities, and opt in to **federated learning (FL)** for AI training. In return, they earn **high-frequency stablecoin rewards**, which can contribute to **decentralized health insurance**.

As an **open-source protocol**, *Doctelligence* promotes **transparency**, **innovation**, and **accessibility**.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*  

- üíª **True Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full control** of your health records while benefiting from AI model training. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring both **privacy** and **security**.  

- ü§ñ **Scalable Federated Learning (FL)**  
  A decentralized AI infrastructure where models are trained across an expanding network of personal data stores‚Äîwithout centralizing or exposing raw data.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Stablecoin Rewards**  
  Earn **direct stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDT)** for securely contributing to AI models. No intermediaries‚Äîjust transparent, trustless compensation.  

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê  

**No single entity owns or controls the Doctelligence network**‚Äîit operates as an **open, permissionless infrastructure**, governed by the community. With an emphasis on **decentralization**, the Foundation supports **community-driven governance**, keeping the protocol **open**, **transparent**, and **adaptable**.

## Explore the White Paper  

Doctelligence's AI peer-peer protocol was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. 

For further insights, check out the **[post from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229826012803395584/)**, where *Doctelligence* is discussed in the context of **emerging decentralized AI technologies**.  

## Get Involved  

*Doctelligence* is part of a growing movement to **decentralize the AI and healthcare economy** while ensuring **data sovereignty**. Whether you're a **developer, researcher, or advocate for decentralized technologies**, there‚Äôs a place for you in this journey.
