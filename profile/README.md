# Welcome to *Doctelligence* üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a **public blockchain protocol** that enables **fully decentralized AI model training**, ensuring **data sovereignty** and privacy. By integrating blockchain, IPFS, federated learning (FL), and privacy-preserving technologies, it provides a scalable, secure framework for AI development without relying on centralized intermediaries.

At its core, *Doctelligence* is decentralized, with interactions immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and accountability. The network is governed by distributed validators, upholding decentralization.

## The *Doctelligence* Network

*Doctelligence* envisions a future where **data owners** and **AI developers** collaborate directly, without middlemen. Through a **decentralized ecosystem**, data remains under the owner‚Äôs control, with only model updates exchanged. This approach preserves privacy and sovereignty.

The core innovation of *Doctelligence* lies in **restructuring federated learning**, transforming data owners and developers into **peer-to-peer participants**. Data owners contribute their data directly for AI training, while developers access decentralized data pools. This **marketplace** enables trustless, direct exchanges, free from intermediaries.

By keeping data under the owner‚Äôs control and removing access barriers, *Doctelligence* offers a clear alternative to centralized AI systems. It empowers decentralized, scalable AI development where collaboration and value exchange are governed by transparent protocols.

*Doctelligence* enables decentralized **federated learning ecosystems**, where models scale across independent compute nodes. Through individual participation, we create a resilient system for training AI models.

**Data owners are compensated in stablecoins**, ensuring a stable exchange, while the blockchain protocol ensures secure, private, and transparent AI model training and data monetization. Fair rewards are guaranteed, free from intermediary extraction.

### Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Sovereignty**  
  Data owners retain full control over their data. Whether stored locally or through decentralized storage solutions, only model updates are shared‚Äîraw data never leaves the owner's control, ensuring privacy.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Models are trained on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for centralized servers. This approach ensures scalability and security, while preserving the privacy of the participants.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Data owners are rewarded directly in stablecoins for their participation in training AI models. By eliminating intermediaries, rewards are efficiently distributed in a transparent and trustless manner.

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê 
The *Doctelligence Foundation* is the steward of the protocol, ensuring the long-term sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. With a focus on decentralization, the Foundation supports community-driven governance, ensuring that the protocol remains open and community-focused.
