# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

Doctelligence is an organization built on the foundation of the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN), a pioneering initiative in the development of decentralized AI and data systems.

At the core of Doctelligence is DIN, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that enables secure and scalable AI training using decentralized data.

## What We Do at Doctelligence

At Doctelligence, we combine cutting-edge technologies to drive the future of decentralized artificial intelligence (DeAI). By integrating blockchain, IPFS, federated learning (FL), & privacy-preserving technologies into a simple yet elegant protocol, we empower organizations to fully unlock the potential of AI. This innovative ecosystem enables the secure, decentralized training of AI models at scale, fostering breakthroughs while ensuring data sovereignty.

### DIN (Decentralized Intelligence Network) empowers both AI developers and data owners:

- **For AI Developers:** DIN provides secure, decentralized access to diverse datasets, enabling scalable model training and fostering innovation without the constraints of centralized data silos.

- **For Data Owners:** DIN enables you to monetize your data while maintaining complete control - whether stored locally or in cost-effective decentralized storage solutions. Only trained model updates are exchanged, never the raw data itself. This approach lets you unlock your data's economic value and fuel AI innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance and eliminating data transfer risks.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Data owners retain full control over their data. Whether stored locally or through decentralized storage solutions, only model updates are shared‚Äîraw data never leaves the owner's control, ensuring privacy.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Models are trained on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for centralized servers. This approach ensures scalability and security, while preserving the privacy of the participants.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Data owners are rewarded directly in stablecoins for their participation in training AI models. By eliminating intermediaries, rewards are efficiently distributed in a transparent and trustless manner.

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê 

The *Doctelligence Foundation* is the steward of the protocol, ensuring the long-term sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. With a focus on decentralization, the Foundation supports community-driven governance, ensuring that the protocol remains open and community-focused.

## Explore the White Paper

*Doctelligence* was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of scaling decentralized AI through data ownership and privacy-preserving methods.
