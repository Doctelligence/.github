# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized infrastructure for AI and data marketplaces, enabling secure, peer-to-peer collaboration without data movement.

## Empowering Data Owners & AI Developers

The **decentralized validators** power the network, enabling **peer-to-peer interactions** within **decentralized applications (dApps)**, ensuring that no single entity controls the process. By integrating **blockchain**, **IPFS**, **federated learning (FL)**, and **privacy-preserving technologies**, we enable scalable AI development without relying on centralized intermediaries, all while ensuring data privacy and security.

Our infrastructure empowers decentralized applications to facilitate both **AI training** and **data monetization** opportunities:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Leverage decentralized infrastructure to **monetize data stores** and establish **AI training opportunities**. Through the secure sharing of **model updates** instead of raw data, both parties can collaborate effectively and scale AI solutions while preserving privacy.

The network operates independently of **centralized compute nodes**, third-party hardware, or intermediaries. Designed as **backend infrastructure**, it supports decentralized applications for **AI training ecosystems** and **data marketplaces**, ensuring secure and seamless exchanges. 

In essence, the **blockchain** acts as the **backend infrastructure**, driving **secure**, **scalable**, and **privacy-preserving AI** solutions within **decentralized applications** ‚Äî all without centralized control.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full ownership** of your data while enabling AI training within a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**. Your data remains under your control, ensuring privacy and security, without the need for data transfers.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI Infrastructure**  
  Leverage a **peer-to-peer network** to securely update models, enhancing both **privacy** and **scalability** for AI development. This decentralized approach ensures efficient collaboration between AI trainers and data owners.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn **stablecoin rewards** directly within the ecosystem for your participation. By eliminating intermediaries, rewards are distributed transparently, promoting fair and efficient compensation for all contributors.

## Foundation üåê 

*Doctelligence Foundation* is the steward of the protocol, ensuring the long-term sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. With a focus on decentralization, the Foundation supports community-driven governance, ensuring that the protocol remains open and community-focused.

## Explore the White Paper

*Doctelligence* was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of scaling decentralized AI through data ownership and privacy-preserving methods.

To understand the technical and philosophical foundations of *Doctelligence*, explore our **[White Paper](https://github.com/Doctelligence/White-Paper/blob/main/Decentralized%20Intelligence%20Network%20(DIN).pdf)**.
