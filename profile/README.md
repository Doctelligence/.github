# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized infrastructure for AI and data marketplaces, enabling secure, peer-to-peer collaboration without data movement.

## Empowering Data Owners & AI Developers

- **For Data Owners**: Retain full control over data while monetizing it through model updates‚Äînot raw data.
- **For AI Developers**: Access diverse **decentralized** data for training AI models without the constraints of centralized silos.

**Decentralized validators** power the network, enabling **peer-to-peer interactions** between **AI trainers** and **data owners**, ensuring that no single entity controls the process. By integrating **blockchain**, **IPFS**, **federated learning (FL)**, and **privacy-preserving technologies**, we enable scalable AI development without relying on centralized intermediaries. 

The network operates independently of **centralized compute nodes**, third-party hardware, or intermediaries. The **network** and **protocol** are designed to serve as **backend infrastructure**, supporting applications for **AI training ecosystems** and **data marketplaces** for exchanges. **Clean transactions** facilitate the **frontend** interactions.

In essence, the **blockchain** serves entirely as the **backend for real utility**, providing the infrastructure that supports **secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving AI** solutions without the need for centralized control.

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Data owners retain full control over their data. Whether stored locally or through decentralized storage solutions, only model updates are shared‚Äîraw data never leaves the owner's control, ensuring privacy.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Models are trained on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for centralized servers. This approach ensures scalability and security, while preserving the privacy of the participants.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Data owners are rewarded directly in stablecoins for their participation in training AI models. By eliminating intermediaries, rewards are efficiently distributed in a transparent and trustless manner.

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê 

The *Doctelligence Foundation* is the steward of the protocol, ensuring the long-term sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. With a focus on decentralization, the Foundation supports community-driven governance, ensuring that the protocol remains open and community-focused.

## Explore the White Paper

*Doctelligence* was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of scaling decentralized AI through data ownership and privacy-preserving methods.
