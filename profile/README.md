# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning (FL) protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure AI collaboration and data monetization. It powers **open AI and data marketplaces**, where models can be trained **without reliance on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers**, supporting individually owned, data-driven economies.

We are recipients of a **Cosmos Institute** Grant: [cosmos-institute.org](https://cosmos-institute.org/), based in Austin, Texas and the University of Oxford.

## 🌍 Empowering Sovereign Data & AI Development

Our infrastructure is ideal for applications that enable the monetization of user-owned data, while providing AI model trainers with a platform that supports FL training for **decentralized data marketplaces**, enabling trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring sovereignty and compliance.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries.

## 🔑 A Unique Approach: Stable Infrastructure, Stablecoin Transactions

A core differentiator of DIN is our use of a **decentralized validator network**, secured via **Proof of Stake** and enhanced by our integration with **Eigenlayer’s Actively Validated Services (AVS) stack**. This allows us to **bootstrap validator participation** using Ethereum’s existing restaking infrastructure—bringing robust security and economic alignment from day one.

> **As a result of Eigenlayer integration, our infrastructure is chain-agnostic within the Ethereum ecosystem**, meaning DIN can be seamlessly deployed across a wide array of Ethereum L2s, rollups, and sidechains. This enhances interoperability and ensures DIN can serve any blockchain solution within the Ethereum family.

Rather than acting as a speculative asset, our native token serves as the **backbone for decentralized infrastructure**, while applications can transact using **stablecoins**.

This model supports:

- **Stablecoin-based transactions** for developers and users  
- **Predictable costs** for AI training and data operations  
- **Interoperability with Ethereum-based DeFi systems**  

Much like traditional financial systems, this design promotes:

- **Stable valuation**  
- **Market exchange compatibility**  
- **Price predictability**  

Whether using established stablecoins or experimenting with new value-pegged tokens, this architecture provides a reliable, non-volatile foundation for decentralized AI and data monetization.

## 🔐 Key Features of Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

- 💻 **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Retain **full control** over your data while enabling AI training in a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**—no centralized oversight or data movement.

- 🤖 **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Utilize **Federated Learning (FL)** in a **peer-to-peer network** for **privacy-preserving AI model updates**. Data never leaves local storage—only encrypted model updates are shared, enabling **secure collaboration** between data providers and AI developers.

- 💰 **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn high-frequency **stablecoin (e.g., RAI) rewards** transparently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring **fair, direct compensation** for all network participants.

- 🔗 **Eigenlayer Integration for Validator Bootstrapping**  
  Our validator network leverages **Eigenlayer's AVS stack**, allowing us to inherit Ethereum’s security model while remaining **chain-agnostic across Ethereum ecosystem chains**—accelerating decentralization, compatibility, and trust from the outset.
