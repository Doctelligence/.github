# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the core of Doctelligence, enables decentralized AI training using underutilized data sources. _DIN_ creates an accessible AI ecosystem that addresses data privacy and accessibility, allowing users to control and monetize their data while earning rewards for contributing to AI training.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we combine decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and privacy-preserving technologies to enhance AI development. _DIN_ enables data owners, including individuals, SMEs, and enterprises, and those using decentralized data storage solutions ‚Äî to retain ownership and monetize their data, unlocking its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, _DIN_ overcomes siloed systems, supports AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- üíª **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ü§ñ **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Our Vision

**Doctelligence** is an open-source framework built on the principles of decentralization and community collaboration. The network itself operates independently, without any central authority, ensuring that all processes and decisions are entirely peer-to-peer.

At the heart of **Doctelligence** are two entities created to derive value and support the network:

- **Doctelligence (Labs)üî¨:** This entity is financed to develop decentralized AI (DecAI) technologies. Its focus is on creating innovative solutions that advance the field of AI in a decentralized, transparent, and open manner, driving technological progress within the network.

- **Doctelligence Foundation üåç:** Supporting the broader mission, the Foundation empowers individuals, organizations, and sectors with decentralized AI technologies. It helps nurture a community-driven ecosystem where innovation, governance, and growth are decentralized, without a single point of control.

While these entities play critical roles in advancing and supporting the network, the decentralized intelligence network (DIN) itself remains independent. The ecosystem thrives through community collaboration, ensuring that it remains open, transparent, and peer-driven at all levels.

## Explore Our White Paper

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** was selected from over **100+ speaker applications** to be showcased at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC. This prestigious recognition underscores **DIN**'s growing role as a leader in the development of responsible, decentralized AI technologies.
