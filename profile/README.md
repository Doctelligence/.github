# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundations of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**. 

DIN provides a decentralized AI network that enables data stores to monetize their information directly while keeping data secure and localized. Users can earn cryptographic rewards for their contributions, enhancing on-device training and maintaining control over their data. This approach eliminates intermediaries, fostering a more efficient and inclusive data ecosystem.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

By integrating decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and incentives, we align individual control with enhanced data efficiency and scalability in AI development

-ðŸ’»**Decentralized Data**
Utilize decentralized data to unlock new opportunities for AI development.

-ðŸ¤–**Blockchain & AI**
Leverage blockchain technology to securely train AI by sharing model updates while protecting data and fostering innovation.

-ðŸ’°**Direct Rewards**
Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, without intermediaries.

**Doctelligence** is dedicated to decentralizing intelligence to enhance outcomes across industries. By keeping data in its original store, DIN ensures compliance and data sovereignty, enabling scalable AI solutions that align with key regulatory bodies.

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Ensuring data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Safeguarding sensitive patient information in the United States.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Providing data privacy rights to residents of California, USA.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data in Canada.
  
## Vision

**Doctelligence** operates as a decentralized, open-source framework with no single entity in control. The **Doctelligence Foundation** supports this ecosystem, while our commercial entities facilitate traditional financing for dedicated research into advanced technologies, benefiting the community and developing industry-specific solutions.

### Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)*, on which *Doctelligence* is founded, is designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. *DIN* facilitates effective AI training within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources. It leverages decentralized technologies to create a more integrated and accessible AI ecosystem.

***DIN* was showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI**, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.

### Explore Our White Paper

- **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)** â€“ This paper introduces the core *DIN* framework, laying the groundwork for decentralized intelligence across various sectors.

### Future Modular Extensions

Other future modular extensions may include, for example:

- **[DHIN (Decentralized Health Intelligence Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240)** â€“ A modular extension of *DIN*, *DHIN* specifically focuses on decentralized health applications, providing a tailored approach to health data management and intelligence.
- **DPIN (Decentralized Physical Intelligence Network):** Tailored for decentralized physical and IoT applications.
- **DEIN (Decentralized EdTech Intelligence Network):** Focused on transforming education through decentralized technologies.
- **DAIN (Decentralized Agritech Intelligence Network):** Aimed at advancing agricultural practices through decentralized innovations.

As we expand the DIN network's capabilities, we explore various theoretical modular extensions where the **DIN toolkit can be deployed, including non-speculative circular token economies.**
