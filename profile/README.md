# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** is a **peer-to-peer blockchain protocol** that enables secure AI model training while ensuring **data sovereignty**. By integrating **blockchain**, **IPFS**, **federated learning (FL)**, and **privacy-preserving technologies**, we enable scalable AI development without relying on centralized intermediaries.

### Empowering Data Owners & AI Developers

- **For Data Owners**: Retain full control over data while monetizing it through model updates‚Äînot raw data.
- **For AI Developers**: Access diverse **decentralized** data for training AI models without the constraints of centralized silos.

## Doctelligence Network

*Doctelligence* facilitates **direct collaboration** between **data owners** and **AI developers** in a **decentralized** ecosystem. Data stays under the owner's control, and only model updates are exchanged, ensuring privacy and sovereignty.

*Doctelligence* enables federated learning to scale organically without centralized compute nodes. As more participants join, the ecosystem grows, making it adaptive and resilient. **Data owners** are rewarded in **stablecoins**, ensuring predictable and stable value exchanges.

### Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Sovereignty**  
  Data owners retain full control over their data. Whether stored locally or through decentralized storage solutions, only model updates are shared‚Äîraw data never leaves the owner's control, ensuring privacy.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Models are trained on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for centralized servers. This approach ensures scalability and security, while preserving the privacy of the participants.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Data owners are rewarded directly in stablecoins for their participation in training AI models. By eliminating intermediaries, rewards are efficiently distributed in a transparent and trustless manner.

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê 
The *Doctelligence Foundation* is the steward of the protocol, ensuring the long-term sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. With a focus on decentralization, the Foundation supports community-driven governance, ensuring that the protocol remains open and community-focused.

## Explore the White Paper

*Doctelligence* was selected as one of the top projects at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This event highlighted *Doctelligence* as the only network capable of scaling decentralized AI through data sovereignty and privacy-preserving methods.

To understand the technical and philosophical foundations of *Doctelligence*, explore our **[White Paper](https://github.com/Doctelligence/White-Paper/blob/main/Decentralized%20Intelligence%20Network%20(DIN).pdf)**.
