# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning (FL) protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure AI collaboration and data monetization. It powers **open AI and data marketplaces**, where models can be trained **without reliance on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers**, supporting individually owned, data-driven economies.

We are recipients of a **Cosmos Institute** Grant: [cosmos-institute.org](https://cosmos-institute.org/), based in Austin, Texas and the University of Oxford.

## 🌍 Empowering Sovereign Data & AI Development

Our infrastructure is ideal for applications that enable the monetization of user-owned data, while providing AI model trainers with a platform that supports FL training for **decentralized data marketplaces**, enabling trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring sovereignty and compliance.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries.

## 🔑 A Unique Approach: Stable Infrastructure, Stablecoin Transactions

One key differentiator of our approach lies in the **decentralized network of validators** securing the ecosystem via **Proof of Stake**. This decentralized structure ensures that our native token serves as the **backbone for secure infrastructure**, rather than as a speculative asset.

In practical terms, our infrastructure supports front-end applications and UIs that engage in **stablecoin transactions**, giving developers the freedom to use stablecoins without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies.

Much like traditional fiat currencies, our stablecoin approach ensures:

- **Stable valuation**
- **Market exchange compatibility**
- **Price predictability**

This removes speculative risks and creates a more reliable environment for developers. The system supports both **existing pegged stablecoins** and **experimental stablecoins** pegged to more sustainable value measures over time.

## 🔐 Key Features of Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

- 💻 **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Retain **full control** over your data while enabling AI training in a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**—no centralized oversight or data movement.

- 🤖 **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Utilize **Federated Learning (FL)** in a **peer-to-peer network** for **privacy-preserving AI model updates**. Data never leaves local storage—only encrypted model updates are shared, enabling **secure collaboration** between data providers and AI developers.

- 💰 **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn high-frequency **stablecoin (e.g., RAI) rewards** transparently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring **fair, direct compensation** for all network participants.

## 🌐 Foundation & Governance

The *Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) Foundation* is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the protocol’s evolution through **open governance** and the promotion of **self-sovereign AI ecosystems**.

Like Ethereum, **no single entity owns the network**. It is sustained by a global community and secured by **decentralized validators**—not centralized gatekeepers. This model ensures long-term sustainability and resilience.
