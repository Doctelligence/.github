# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundations of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**. Dedicated to creating a self-sovereign ecosystem that transcends sectors, we empower individuals and organizations through data sovereignty, scalable AI, and decentralized technologies. Our mission drives innovation and accessibility across various industries, fueled by **a culture of openness, experimentation, and inclusivity.** 

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enable self-sovereign, decentralized networks** that fosters trust and autonomy across different sectors.
- üìà **Leverage blockchain and federated learning** to enable secure and privacy-preserving AI model training.
- üåç **Promote an ecosystem where participants are rewarded** for contributing data, fueling innovation and equity in various fields.

*Doctelligence* is committed to decentralizing intelligence and enhancing outcomes across industries by aligning with global standards and frameworks. By ensuring that data never leaves its original store, *Doctelligence*'s approach naturally complies with regulations, preserving data sovereignty while facilitating scalable and innovative AI solutions. Our model aligns with key regulatory bodies, including:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Ensuring data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Safeguarding sensitive patient information in the United States.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Providing data privacy rights to residents of California, USA.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data in Canada.
  
***Doctelligence* operates as a decentralized and open-source framework; no single entity owns or controls it.** This collaborative model ensures that it remains a truly community-driven initiative.

## Vision
*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)*, on which *Doctelligence* is founded, is designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. *DIN* facilitates effective AI training within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources. It leverages decentralized technologies to address key challenges in data fragmentation and siloing, enabling a more integrated and accessible AI ecosystem.

***DIN* was showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.** Explore our white paper here:

- **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)** ‚Äì This paper introduces the core *DIN* framework, laying the groundwork for decentralized intelligence across various sectors.

Other future modular extensions may include, for example:

- **[DHIN (Decentralized Health Intelligence Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240)** ‚Äì A modular extension of *DIN*, DHIN specifically focuses on decentralized health applications, providing a tailored approach to health data management and intelligence.
- **DPIN (Decentralized Physical Intelligence Network):** Tailored for decentralized physical and IoT applications.
- **DEIN (Decentralized EdTech Intelligence Network):** Focused on transforming education through decentralized technologies.
- **DAIN (Decentralized Agritech Intelligence Network):** Aimed at advancing agricultural practices through decentralized innovations.

As we expand the DIN network's capabilities, we explore various theoretical modular extensions where the **DIN toolkit can be deployed, including non-speculative, stablecoin-based, circular token economies.** For the Doctelligence community, ensuring fair rewards and stable data valuation is crucial. Guidance includes exploring stablecoins for reliable compensation and to mitigate volatility, while also considering other mechanisms to maintain data value across network extensions.
