# Welcome to Doctelligence üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is a pioneering decentralized framework designed to build a self-sovereign ecosystem that transcends sectors. Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations through data sovereignty, scalable AI, and decentralized technologies, driving innovation and accessibility across various industries.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Create a self-sovereign, decentralized network** that fosters trust and autonomy across different sectors.
- üìà **Leverage blockchain and federated learning** to enable secure and privacy-preserving AI model training.
- üåç **Promote an ecosystem where participants are rewarded** for contributing data, fueling innovation and equity in various fields.

*Doctelligence* is committed to decentralizing intelligence and enhancing outcomes across industries by aligning with global standards and frameworks. By ensuring that data never leaves its original store, *Doctelligence*'s approach naturally complies with regulations, preserving data sovereignty while facilitating scalable and innovative AI solutions. Our model aligns with key regulatory bodies, including:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Ensuring data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**: Governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data in Canada.
  
***Doctelligence* operates as a decentralized and open-source framework; no single entity owns or controls it.** This collaborative model ensures that it remains a truly community-driven initiative.

## Vision & Beginnings:
*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)* framework, on which *Doctelligence* is founded, is designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. *DIN* facilitates effective AI training within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources. It leverages decentralized technologies to address key challenges in data fragmentation and siloing, enabling a more integrated and accessible AI ecosystem.

***DIN* was showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.** Explore our white paper here:

- **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)** ‚Äì This paper introduces the core *DIN* framework, laying the groundwork for decentralized intelligence across various sectors.

Other future modular extensions may include, for example:

- **[DHIN (Decentralized Health Intelligence Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240)** ‚Äì A modular extension of *DIN*, DHIN specifically focuses on decentralized health applications, providing a tailored approach to health data management and intelligence.
- **DPIN (Decentralized Physical Intelligence Network):** Tailored for decentralized physical and IoT applications.
- **DFIN (Decentralized Financial Intelligence Network):** Designed for financial applications and DeFi.
- **DCIN (Decentralized City Intelligence Network):** Geared towards smart city and IoT integrations.
- **DEIN (Decentralized Education Intelligence Network):** Focused on transforming education through decentralized technologies.
- **DAIN (Decentralized Agriculture Intelligence Network):** Aimed at advancing agricultural practices through decentralized innovations.

As we expand the DIN network's capabilities, we explore various theoretical modular extensions where the DIN toolkit can be deployed, including circular token economies. For the Doctelligence community, ensuring fair rewards and stable data valuation is crucial. Guidance includes exploring stablecoins for reliable compensation and to mitigate volatility, while also considering other mechanisms to maintain data value across network extensions.
