# Doctelligence Network 🚀  

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized infrastructure for self-sovereign networks, enabling secure, peer-to-peer AI collaboration and data monetization without relinquishing ownership.  

## 🔄 **Circular Data Economies** 
Traditional data economies concentrated wealth at the top, while data contributors remained uncompensated. **Doctelligence** enables a **circular economy**, where **data owners receive continuous rewards**, and AI-driven insights **feed back into goods and services** that return value across industries—creating **cross-sector self-sustaining innovation**.  

## **Empowering Self-Sovereign Data & AI Development**  

Our infrastructure supports **AI training** and **decentralized data marketplaces**, enabling trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers:  

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring sovereignty and compliance.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries.  

## **Key Features of Doctelligence**  

- 💻 **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Retain **full control** over your data while enabling AI training in a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**—no centralized oversight or data movement.  

- 🤖 **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Utilize **Federated Learning (FL)** and a **peer-to-peer network** to enable **privacy-preserving AI model updates**. Data never leaves local storage—only encrypted model improvements are shared, ensuring **secure collaboration** between data providers and AI developers.  

- 💰 **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn high-frequency **stablecoin (e.g., RAI) rewards** transparently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring **fair, direct compensation** for all network participants.  

## **Foundation & Governance** 🌐   

The *Doctelligence Foundation* oversees protocol evolution, fostering **open governance** and **self-sovereign AI ecosystems**. Decentralization is core to ensuring **long-term sustainability** without centralized gatekeepers.  

We are recipient of **Cosmos Institute** Grant: https://cosmos-institute.org/ based in Austin, Texas and University of Oxford.

## **Explore the White Paper**  

*Doctelligence* was recognized at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI, as a groundbreaking infrastructure for **self-sovereign AI and data ownership**.
