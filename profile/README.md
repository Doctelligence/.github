# Welcome to *Doctelligence* üöÄ

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of the **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, a pioneering initiative in the development of decentralized AI and data systems.

At the core of *Doctelligence* is **DIN**, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that enables secure and scalable AI training using decentralized data.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*

At Doctelligence, we combine cutting-edge technologies to drive the future of **decentralized artificial intelligence (DeAI)**. By integrating blockchain, federated learning (FL), privacy-preserving technologies, IPFS, and ZKPs into a simple yet elegant protocol, we empower organizations to fully unlock the potential of AI. This innovative ecosystem enables the secure, decentralized training of AI models at scale, fostering breakthroughs while ensuring data sovereignty.

**DIN** (Decentralized Intelligence Network) empowers both AI developers and data owners:

- **For AI Developers**: DIN provides secure, decentralized access to diverse datasets, enabling scalable model training and fostering innovation without the constraints of centralized data silos.
  
- **For Data Owners**: DIN enables you to monetize your data while maintaining complete control - whether stored locally or in cost-effective decentralized storage solutions. Only trained model updates are exchanged, never the raw data itself. This approach lets you unlock your data's economic value and fuel AI innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance and eliminating data transfer risks.

### Key Features of *Doctelligence*

- üíª **Data Ownership**  
  Store your data locally or in decentralized storage while unlocking its full value.

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI**  
  Train AI models across a network where only model updates are shared, ensuring data privacy.

- üí∞ **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn rewards (i.e., stablecoin) for participating in AI training processes, without intermediaries.

## The Entities Behind *Doctelligence*

*Doctelligence* consists of two key entities that support and advance the **DIN** network:

- **DIN Labs üî¨**  
  This entity focuses on developing decentralized AI (DecAI) technologies, advancing innovative, open, and transparent solutions that push the boundaries of decentralized AI.

- **Doctelligence Foundation üåê**  
  The Foundation fosters a community-driven ecosystem where decentralized AI technologies are accessible to all. It supports innovation, governance, and growth within the network, ensuring that development is decentralized and no single entity has control.

**DIN**, the network itself, operates independently and is secured by a decentralized network of participants. It is not owned or controlled by any single party, and all interactions within the network are transparently recorded on an immutable public blockchain. This decentralized architecture promotes openness, transparency, and collective participation, ensuring that **DIN** remains a truly community-driven network.

## Explore Our White Paper

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** has been selected from over **100+ speaker applications** to be showcased at the **[Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence: The Future of Decentralization and AI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/decentralizationaisummit24)**, hosted by Berkeley RDI. This prestigious event showcased **DIN** as the only integrated network for **Decentralized AI (DeAI)**, highlighting its unique potential in advancing decentralized AI and data sovereignty. The summit featured contributions from some of the most influential organizations and leaders in the fields of AI and decentralization, including **NVIDIA**, **Google**, **Oasis Labs (Founder)**, and **Worldcoin Foundation** to name a few.
