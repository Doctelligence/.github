# Doctelligence Network üöÄ

**Doctelligence** puts individuals in control of their **health records**, securely stored for life. It enables **private AI training** on data without exposure and rewards users with **stablecoins** (e.g., RAI, USDT) for participation. With just an internet connection, anyone can access the network, create local healthcare solutions, and contribute to a **self-funded health system**. As an **open-source** platform, *Doctelligence* is built for **transparency, innovation, and access**.  

## Key Features of *Doctelligence*  

- üíª **True Data Ownership**  
  Maintain **full control** of your health records while benefiting from AI model training. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring both **privacy** and **security**.  

- ü§ñ **Scalable Federated Learning (FL)**  
  A decentralized AI infrastructure where models are trained across an expanding network of personal data stores‚Äîwithout centralizing or exposing raw data.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Stablecoin Rewards**  
  Earn **direct stablecoin rewards (e.g., USDT)** for securely contributing to AI models. No intermediaries‚Äîjust transparent, trustless compensation.  

## Doctelligence Foundation üåê  

**No single entity owns or controls the Doctelligence network**‚Äîit operates as an **open, permissionless infrastructure**, governed by the community. With an emphasis on **decentralization**, the Foundation supports **community-driven governance**, keeping the protocol **open**, **transparent**, and **adaptable**.
