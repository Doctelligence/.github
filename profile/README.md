# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** enables data ownership by allowing users to monetize their data in a decentralized AI ecosystem, earning direct rewards for contributing to AI training while maintaining control over their information.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we combine decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and privacy-preserving technologies to enhance AI development. DIN enables data owners, including individuals, SMEs, and enterprises, to retain ownership and monetize their data, unlocking its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, DIN overcomes siloed systems, supports AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- ðŸ’» **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ðŸ¤– **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- ðŸ’° **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Vision

**Doctelligence** is a decentralized, open-source framework supported by the **Doctelligence Foundation**, with no single controlling entity. **Doctelligence Labs** facilitates traditional funding for dedicated research into advanced technologies, delivering industry-specific solutions and benefiting the broader community.

### Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the foundation of Doctelligence, is designed to enable decentralized AI training across previously under-utilized decentralized data sources. By leveraging decentralized technologies, _DIN_ creates an integrated and accessible AI ecosystem that addresses both data accessibility and privacy concerns.
