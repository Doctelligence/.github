# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning (FL) protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure AI collaboration and data monetization. It powers **open AI and data marketplaces**, where models can be trained **without reliance on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers**, supporting individually owned, data-driven economies.

We are recipients of a **Cosmos Institute** Grant: [cosmos-institute.org](https://cosmos-institute.org/), based in Austin, Texas and the University of Oxford.

## üîÑ Circular Economies  

Data economies have historically concentrated wealth at the top, often leaving contributors uncompensated. **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** enables a **circular economy**, where applications neable **data owners to receive stablecoins**, and AI-driven insights **feed back into goods and services** that return value across ecosystems‚Äîdriving **cross-sector, self-sustaining innovation**.

Blockchain technology opened the door to reconstructing our social and economic configurations‚Äîbypassing middle-persons to enable more inclusive, cooperative systems. It was as much a posibility for **social technology** as a technical one. These networks reshaped the rules of participation, laying the groundwork for systems like **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** to empower individuals within data ecosystems, rather than extract from them.

## üåç Empowering Sovereign Data & AI Development  

Our infrastructure is ideal for **self-sovereign identity networks** and **decentralized data ecosystems**, and supports FL training for **decentralized data marketplaces**, enabling trustless interactions between data owners and AI developers:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring sovereignty and compliance.  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries.

## üîë A Unique Approach: Stable Infrastructure, Stablecoin Transactions  

One key differentiator of our approach lies in the **decentralized network of validators** securing the ecosystem via **Proof of Stake**. This decentralized structure ensures that our native token serves as the **backbone for secure infrastructure**, rather than as a speculative asset. In practical terms, this means our infrastructure can be leveraged by front-end applications and UIs that engage in **stablecoin transactions**, giving developers the freedom to use stablecoins without the volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.  

Much like how traditional fiat currencies are used in today‚Äôs financial systems, our stablecoin approach ensures **stable valuation**, **market exchanges**, and **price stability**‚Äîall while avoiding speculative risks. This creates a stable and secure environment for developers, which can be leveraged for both **existing pegged stablecoins** or even **experimental stablecoins** pegged to more sustainable value measures over time.  

This system ultimately combines the benefits of decentralized security, stable valuations, and flexible use cases, making it a more reliable infrastructure for the future of decentralized finance and AI ecosystems.

## üîê Key Features of Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)  

- üíª **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Retain **full control** over your data while enabling AI training in a secure, **decentralized infrastructure**‚Äîno centralized oversight or data movement.  

- ü§ñ **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Utilize **Federated Learning (FL)** and a **peer-to-peer network** to enable **privacy-preserving AI model updates**. Data never leaves local storage‚Äîonly encrypted model improvements are shared, ensuring **secure collaboration** between data providers and AI developers.  

- üí∞ **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn high-frequency **stablecoin (e.g., RAI) rewards** transparently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring **fair, direct compensation** for all network participants.

## üåê Foundation & Governance  

*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) Foundation* is a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting the evolution of the protocol through **open governance** and the advancement of **self-sovereign AI ecosystems**. Much like Ethereum, **no single entity owns the network**‚Äîit is sustained by a global community and secured through **decentralized validators** rather than centralized gatekeepers. This decentralized foundation ensures the **long-term sustainability** and resilience of the ecosystem.
