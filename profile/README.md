# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the core of Doctelligence, enables decentralized AI training using underutilized data sources. _DIN_ creates an accessible AI ecosystem that addresses data privacy and accessibility, allowing users to control and monetize their data while earning rewards for contributing to AI training.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we combine decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and privacy-preserving technologies to enhance AI development. _DIN_ enables data owners, including individuals, SMEs, and enterprises, and those using decentralized data storage solutions â€” to retain ownership and monetize their data, unlocking its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, _DIN_ overcomes siloed systems, supports AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- ðŸ’» **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- ðŸ¤– **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- ðŸ’° **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Our Vision

- **Doctelligence** is an open-source framework driven by the principles of decentralization and community collaboration. ....**DIN labs** is the arm of Doctelligence that develops technologies for DecAI as a comerical arm which can also support insitutional side chains..... Supported by the **Doctelligence Foundation**, our mission is to empower individuals, organizations, and various sectors through transparent, decentralized AI technologies. With no central authority, we enable innovation and growth driven by the community, ensuring a fair and functional ecosystem for all participants.
